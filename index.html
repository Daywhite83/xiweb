<h1>Welcome to xiweb</h1>

<h4>What is xiweb?</h4>
	<p>xiweb is a website to show stats from a landsandboat server, which is a ffxi emulator.</p>

<h4>Why is the website ugly? What happened to Canaria?</h4>
	<p>The Canaria server is still alive but we have rebranded as xiweb to promote xiweb, you can download this tool onto your own
server to see stats from your database. The website has been cleaned of all images to make it AGPL friendly, hopefully soon
it will contain new art.</p>

<h4>Can I still connect to topaz.catsangel.com?</h4>
	<p>Yes :D, but will recommend to use the new server address xiweb.catsangel.com as will be phasing out the old subdomain.</p>

<h4>Where can I find steps on how to setup my client to populate the database?</h4>
	<p>Please visit <a href="https://wiki.catsangel.com">Our Wiki</a> to find how to install your client.</p>

<h4>Is here a discord server?</h4>
	<p>Yes, you can access it <a href="https://discord.gg/77j69vffNM">here</a>. I just recently opened up a rocket chat server,
which hasn't been configured fully yet. You can access it just by going to <a href="https://rocketchat.catsangel.com">
rocketchat.catsangel.com</a> using a browser or the phone/desktop app.</p>

<h4>What are the server rules?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Don't be mean to people (discriminate, etc).</li>
		<li>Don't exploit the game.</li>
		<li>If you find an exploit, tell us in discord/rocketchat</li>
		<li>You can multibox, and use addons, plugins; as long as you are not messing other people's fun.</li>
		<li>Keep the drama away from in-game chat and/or discord/rocketchat, we are here to have fun.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>What are the server settings?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>No levelcap, You can level up to 99, and wear iLvl gear</li>
		<li>Trusts are enabled</li>
		<li>All quality of life updates (Book/Crystal teleport, Field/Ground of Valor, Records of Eminence)</li>
		<li>Content is not locked, you can access all missions/expansions, as long as they have been scripted</li>
	</ul>

<h4>How can I contribute to the project?</h4>
	<p>You can contribute by reporting bugs either in Discord/Rocketchat or directly into the Landsandboat github repo. You
can also contribute by improving our wiki or website.</p>
